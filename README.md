# <Module-1-Challenge>

## Description

- This code displays the "Horiseon" homepage.
- I wanted to deploy this site after adding comments and semantic elements without changing the page functionally or astetically.
- I edited the html and css to include semantic elements so that this page is more accesible.
- This increases accesibility and helps other developers walk through the code.
- I learned which html tags are best used in standard practice and for accesibility. I learned how to name and connect css classes and what alt attributes are.
- Given more time I would further compress and improve the css sheet.
