This code displays the "Horiseon" homepage. 
I edited the html and css to include semantic elements so that this page is more accesible.
I learned which html tags are best used in standard practice and for accesibility. I learned how to name and connect css classes. I learned what alt attributes are. 
This project stands out to me as an expression of my desire to thouroughly explain and cleanly organize content. 
Given more time I would further compress and improve the css sheet.
